# resnet9-on-cifar10
The following repo explores a ResNet9 model for cifar-10 image classification with convolutional neural network and it is able to achieve an accuracy nearly 92%.By applying data augmentation,batch normalization we made our model more generalized which trained the model more accurately. ResNet-9 architecture is a convolutional neural net with 9 layers and skip connections in-between.
